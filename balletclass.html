		<h1>Ballet Class</h1>
		<p>Generally, a ballet class follows a particular structure. Every class begins with <strong>barre exercises</strong>. The next exercises 
		include both exercises in the <strong>center of the floor</strong> and <strong>from the corner</strong>. Depending on the skill level 
		of the class, the dancers are <strong>en pointe</strong> for the remainder of class. Finally, <strong>reverence</strong>.</p>

		<h3>Barre Exercises</h3>

		width="300" alt="Dancers at ballet barre">
		<p>Collectively, all the dancers in the class begin at the barre. These exercises serve as the warm up and the time to practice
		technique while having the physical barre for support. There are specific names for each type of barre exercise, most of which are from the French 
		language, and they are done in a particular order. The ballet instructor leads the class through each exercise, starting with plies (which means 'to bend' 
		in French). You always start with the left hand on the barre first and each exercise is usually done twice (once on each side).</p>
		<h3>Exercises on the Floor (Center and Corner)</h3>
		<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/27/arts/27TRAINING1/merlin_149114889_cf457ef2-f181-4983-8ea0-a5e75acd934c-superJumbo.jpg" 
		width="300" alt="Four dancers in center of floor">
		<p>This is the time for the instructor to lead variations that build off of what was practiced at the barre. The instructor 
		will start off by demonstrating the combination of movements that they want the dancers to do, then the dancers memorize this and do it.
		Dancers will either participate all together, break into small groups, or do these exercises individually in front of everyone else. Some common 
		variations to do across the floor include pirouettes (turns on the toe) and grand allegro combinations (powerful movements with lots of big jumps). </p>
		<h3>En Pointe</h3>

		width="300" alt="Dancers in pointe shoes">
		<p>Pointe shoes are hard toed and made of satin and paper mache. They allow dancers to dance on the very tips of their toes. 
		In order to dance well en pointe, dancers need to make sure that they stretch their feet in the pointe shoes before starting to dance in them.
		The ankles are especially important to warm up so that injury can be prevented. For this part of class, the instructor leads the dancers through 
		a warm up and then through exercises across the floor.</p>
		<h3>Reverence</h3>
		<img src="images/reverence.jpg" width="300" alt="Ballet dancer bowing">
		<p>Reverence (pronounced reh-vah-rahnss in French) signifies the end of class. All dancers spread out in the middle of the floor and the 
		instructor leads a final exercise that includes lots of port de bras (movements of the arms) and ends with a bow, or curtsy. Everyone claps, and class is over!</p>
		<h3>Lastly...</h3>
		<p>Each day in a ballet class can be vastly different. The instructor can choose to do different variations of exercises each day, and depending 
		on how they're feeling, they can make the dancers have to work much harder than they did the day before. Dancing is fun, but it's not easy. So, it's best 
		to appraoch the experience with as much of a "yes I can" attitude as possible!
