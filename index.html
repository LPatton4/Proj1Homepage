		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<img scr="OneDrive/Pictures/ImageOfLeah.jpg" alt="Image of Leah">
		<p>My name is Leah Patton. I am a first year student at IIT and I am majoring in Digital Humanities. I am still not too sure
		what I want to do with my degree after I graduate, but I have enjoyed the courses that I have taken so far.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. I have never traveled outside of the United States, but I have lots of dream destinations
		that I would like to visit one one day. I enjoy learning about other cultures, so I do so from home by studying the maps of other countries, 
		trying to learn foreign languages, and watching travel related content online.</p>
		<p>I have always been a relatively active person. When I was very young, I took gymnastics classes. By the time that I was 4 years old, 
		I started taking ballet classes and continued until I was 18 years old. Because of the pandemic, classes have now become 
		less accessible, so I still dance from home, but not nearly as often. I also participated in band classes from the time that I was 7 years 
		old until I graduated high school.</p>
		<h3>The Additional Content That You Will Find on This Site</h3>
		<h4>Resume Page</h4>
		<p>I have not had very much work experience, so this page will be a not so extensive advertisement of my work experience, 
		educational background, and skills.</p>
		<h4>Ballet Class</h4>
		<p>As I mentioned previously, ballet was a huge part of my life before starting college. This page is dedicated to teaching you about some 
		of the basic things that you need to know before taking a ballet class. I will give some fun facts, descriptions of common ballet movements, and 
		instructional information about what to expect in a ballet class.
